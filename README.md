I've created this for me to play around with typescript specifically with react in web development.

### Function

I'd like to have some navbars, sidebars, internal linking, and about 5 pages. Beyond that it might be fun to start a little area for recipes and link it to a db somewhere for my own reference.

### Installation

Straightforward as any github project
Note: I uses `npm` in the original installation so be aware of that if you plan to fork this and prefer using `yarn` to add packages.
